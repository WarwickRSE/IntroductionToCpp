# IntroductionToCpp

These are the example codes and exercises for the Warwick RSE introduction
to C++ half-day workshop

Here you will find the following:

* Slides.pdf
  * Slides describing C++ features - the ones we showed and more that we didn't
* FromSlides directory
  * All of the code from the slides, organised roughly by complexity
* Exercises.pdf
  * Exercises to work through, from compiling your first program to going it alone
* Exercises directory
  * Sample code to use with the Exercises sheet
* Model Solutions directory
  * Solutions to the exercises
  * Remember these are only one way to solve the problem, not necessarily the only one

# More advanced stuff

If you want some more material, we have a repository at https://github.com/WarwickRSE/CPP4Researchers
which explores more of the STL and introduces things like templating and classes.
